# Overview

BigWebThing is intended to provide a combined and improved solution to the problem of sharing messages and programs conveniently and securely.

User data is kept on their own machine, and never sent out unencrypted. Users' private crypto keys never leave their own machine.

Users can write programs and send them to each other safely and run them safely.

There is a message-passing server for sharing data between people.

The cost of running the server is met by users paying for the resources they use, as they use them.

It operates on a strict whitelist-only policy, so you only receive messages from people on your whitelist.

# Program structure

These are the different parts of the program:

1. (Go) The client backend. This runs on the client's computer and does most of the work, such as caching, crypto, and communicating with the server and the GUI.

2. (Elm) The GUI. This runs in a stripped-down web browser via webview.

3. (Javascript) The GUI plumbing. This handles the connection between the client backend and the Elm GUI, passing data through ports to Elm and websockets to the client backend.

4. (Rust / Webassembly) The user programs. These are programs that users can write and send to each other. They are pure functions written in Rust and compiled to Webassembly, and produce a DOM-like structure from a user input text box and user-uploaded binary blobs.

6. (Go) The server. This acts as a route between clients. They upload and download messages, and also use it to store their public keys.

# User ID displayed to the user

A user ID has two components:

1. The username generated by the server. This is a uint64, which is a unique ID in communications with the server. Since most usernames will not use most of the bits, it is displayed to the user as a variable-length integer at the end of their public-key fingerprint. The public-key fingerprint is a fixed length so it is clear which is which.

2. A fingerprint of the static public crypto key. This needs to be long enough so that it is infeasible to mount a man-in-the-middle attack. So if there is an adversary in control of the communication channel, in order to mount a man-in-the-middle, they need to find a pair of keys that matches the fingerprint for each party. If I use a very slow hash to generate the fingerprint, then a uint64 should be sufficient as a fingerprint.

So the whole user ID is:

	very_slow_hash(public_key)[:8] || username

The encoding uses a custom word list with about 8000 words, very similar to Diceware. So for someone with a 3-byte username, their user ID will be 11 bytes, which will require 7 words, like:

# Client backend API

The client backend provides a server on port 11833. It provides a static file server on /static, a websockets server, and an HTTP API. Websockets are useful for the client backend to push new messages to the front-end when they happen. HTTP is good because I can dump very large file uploads into the request bodies and stream them over to the backend. Elm does not have a native websockets capability, so it has to be done via a port. Everything that goes through an Elm port has to be a string in memory, so binary data has to be chunked and encoded to a string.

# Server API

The server provides a TCP server on port 11453.

## Proof of work

Some APIs are protected by a proof of work problem. To create a proof of work token, the user must download some unique bytes and a difficulty value from the server, and find some more unique bytes that will create a 32-byte slow hash with all the bytes greater than the difficulty. The 'slow' hash should not be that slow. It should be slow enough that any implementation details apart from hashing are amortised. So a proof of work token is like this:

+ 16 bytes: unique from the server
+ 8 bytes: calculated by the client

The server checks that the first part is indeed something that it recently gave out, then that the hash of the whole meets the current difficulty.

## Username encoding

A username is a variable-length integer, at least one byte long. It is encoded by prefixing it by a byte containing its length.

## TCP API

It will accept incoming TCP connections. A connection begins unauthenticated, and can change to authenticated. Messages that are only sent/acceptable on an authenticated channel are marked "AUTH".

Each message should be not more than 16KB, and should start with a 2-byte Little-Endian length.

Server to client

	New message from another user (AUTH)
		1 byte: 0
        8 bytes: sender username
        15983 bytes: the message
    New username (AUTH)
        1 byte: 1
        8 bytes: username
    Proof of work info
        1 byte: 2
		1 byte: difficulty
		16 bytes: random
    Price (AUTH)
        1 byte: 3
        4 bytes: price in GBP^(-4)

Client to server

    Get proof of work info
        1 byte: 0
    Sign in
        1 byte: 1
	    16 bytes: secret session key
	    8 bytes: username
    New account
		1 byte: 2

		16 bytes: random session key
        32 bytes: public static encryption key
	Send message (AUTH)
		1 byte: 3
		8 bytes: recipient username
		15991 bytes: message
	Delete message (AUTH)
		1 byte: 4
		32 bytes: message hash

# Client to client

## API

A message is a tarred Git repository.

Then the message is sliced up into chunks, each chunk is encrypted, and is sent.

Before encryption, a chunk must be exactly 15894 bytes long. A chunk is encoded like this:

15894 bytes
    either the whole message fits in one chunk
        1 byte: 0
        2 bytes: the length of the message
        the message
        padding
    or this is a part of a sequence but not the last item
        1 byte: 1
        4 bytes: chunk counter, starting at 0
        4 bytes: total number of chunks in the sequence
        the chunk
    or this is the final message in a sequence
        1 byte: 2
        32 bytes: the hash of the whole message before chunking
        2 bytes: length of the chunk
        the chunk
        padding

## Crypto

The cryptography is done using golang.org/x/crypto/nacl/box. Each user has a pair of static keys. For each of their contacts they have a public static key and some public temporary keys. Temporary keys are used once only and then deleted. The server will accept messages that are 15991 bytes long:

15991 bytes
    24 bytes: random nonce
    15967 bytes: Nacl box encrypted with recipient's static public key
        16 bytes: encryption overhead
        8 bytes: counter that increments for every message sent, reject messages where the counter hasn't increased
        15943 bytes
            either transport message
                1 byte: 0
                32 bytes: temporary public key used for encryption
                15910 bytes: Nacl box encrypted with temporary public key and blank nonce
                    16 bytes: encryption overhead
                    15894 bytes: plain text
            or fresh key supply
                1 byte: 1
                15936 bytes: 498 32-byte temporary public keys
                6 bytes: padding
