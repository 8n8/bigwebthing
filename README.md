BigWebThing version 4
=====================

# Overview

BigWebThing is a system for constructing and publishing documents.

The main principle is that the server logs everything it can and publishes everything. Any privacy there is comes from the client, such as end-to-end encryption.

# User interface

It's a command-line app. The commands are:

	Update crypto

		$ bwt

	Get usage

		$ bwt help

	Get my ID

		$ bwt myid

	Read messages

		$ bwt read

	Write a message

		$ bwt write <recipient ID> "hi ..."

	Add contact

		$ bwt addcontact <contact ID>

	Make a dummy Â£1 payment to the server - TESTING ONLY

		$ bwt pay

# Client cache

File containing client's static Noise key pair
SQLITE database
	session secrets
		session ID
		secret

# Server cache

+ File containing server's static Noise key pair.

+ SQLITE database
	payments
		payer public key
		amount
	KK1 messages
        24 bytes message remainder
        24 bytes session ID
		sender public Noise key
		recipient public Noise key
	KK2 messages
		72 bytes message
        24 bytes session ID
		sender public Noise key
		recipient public Noise key

# Server API

All requests to the server should be made with the Noise IK pattern, using the hard-coded server public static Noise key.

This API is a minimal version that just allows sending and reading messages. It will eventually allow the user to query anything on the server database.

# KK message encoding

49 bytes: KK1
	1 byte: 0
	48 bytes: KK1 with empty payload
73 bytes: KK2
	1 byte: 1
	24 bytes: start of corresponding KK1, used as a session ID
	48 bytes: KK2 with empty payload
97 bytes: KK transport
	1 byte: 2
	24 bytes: start of corresponding KK1, used as a session ID
	72 bytes: encrypted 56-byte message with 16 byte overhead

# Chunking

Each chunk must be no longer than 256^2 - 16 - 32 - 1 = 65487:

    either
        1 byte: 0 if not the last
        65486 bytes: chunk
    or
        1 byte: 1 if the last
        >= 65486 bytes: chunk
